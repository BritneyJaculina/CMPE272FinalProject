<br/>Britney Jaculina: I worked on creating the react app and connecting it to Spring boot. I also worked on creating endpoints to get professors by semester and 

<br/>
<br/>Justin Pau: I worked on setting up our spring boot application which served as our backend. I made models for users and courses. I also made controllers for api endpoints. Then I set up spring security and that involved refactoring roles from a string to it's own model. Users would be able to login as a certain role and be able to access certain api endpoints based on their role. I created a register and log in endpoint. When users register their password is encrypted and saved to the database. When a user logs in they get back a jwt token and the user's role. Next I worked on the react page for user log in. I made a call to the backend api and saved the token in local storage. Upon succesful log in they get redirected to a page based on their role. Finally, I did the css for each react page.

<br/>Pranav Garg: I worked on building the backend apis like getting/updating user and course data while also building the functionality for the faculty home page.

Once the project was completed I worked on deploying the java springboot app to an ec2 aws instance.
